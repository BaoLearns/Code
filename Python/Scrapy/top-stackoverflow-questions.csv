<p>Here is a piece of <strong>C++</strong> code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""sum = "" &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in <strong>11.54</strong> seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in <strong>1.93</strong> seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in <strong>Java</strong>.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(""sum = "" + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With a somewhat similar, but less extreme result.</p>

<hr>

<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but my next thought was how silly that is, because the array was just generated.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient. I was doing a naive search — picking one sock and ""iterating"" the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n<sup>2</sup>/8 socks on average.</p>

<p>As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.</p>

<p>Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).</p>

<p><strong>So, the question is basically:</strong></p>

<p>Given a pile of <code>n</code> pairs of socks, containing <code>2n</code> elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)</p>

<p>I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>A general <em>theoretical</em> solution for a huge number of socks.</li>
<li>The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)</li>
<li>Is it equivalent to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem"">element distinctness problem</a>?</li>

<p>We believe that Stack Overflow should not just be a resource for very specific technical questions, but also for general guidelines on how to solve variations on common problems. ""Form based authentication for websites"" should be a fine topic for such an experiment.</p>

<h3>It should include topics such as:</h3>

<ul>
<li>How to log in</li>
<li>How to remain logged in</li>
<li>How to store passwords</li>
<li>Using secret questions</li>
<li>Forgotten username/password functionality</li>
<li><a href=""http://openid.net/"">OpenID</a></li>
<li>""Remember me"" checkbox</li>

<li>Secret URLs (public <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator"">URL</a> protected by digest)</li>
<li>Checking password strength</li>
<li>E-mail validation</li>
<li>and much more about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form-based_authentication"">form based authentication</a> ...</li>
</ul>

<h3>It should not include things like:</h3>

<ul>
<li>roles and authorization</li>

<p>I've recently started maintaining someone else's JavaScript code. I'm fixing bugs, adding features and also trying to tidy up the code and make it more consistent.</p>

<p>The previous developer uses two ways of declaring functions and I can't work out if there is a reason behind it or not.</p>

<p>The two ways are:</p>

<pre><code>var functionOne = function() {
    // Some code
};
</code></pre>



<pre><code>function functionTwo() {
    // Some code
}
</code></pre>

<p>What are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each? Is there anything that can be done with one method that can't be done with the other?</p>

<p>I'm using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSLint"">JSLint</a> to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace <code>==</code> (two equals signs) with <code>===</code> (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing <code>idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0</code> inside of an <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>Is there a performance benefit to replacing <code>==</code> with <code>===</code>? </p>

<p>Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.</p>

<p>If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over <code>==</code>?</p>

<p>This question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year.</p>

<p>Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <strong><em>there are very many very bad C++ books</em></strong> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>

<p>Please edit the accepted answer to provide <strong>quality books</strong> and an approximate skill level — <em>preferably</em> <strong>after</strong> <em>discussing your addition in <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec"">the C++ chat room</a></em>. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.  Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review. </p>

<p>If I run the following program, which parses two date strings referencing times one second apart and compares them:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException {
    SimpleDateFormat sf = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"");  
    String str3 = ""1927-12-31 23:54:07"";  
    String str4 = ""1927-12-31 23:54:08"";  
    Date sDt3 = sf.parse(str3);  
    Date sDt4 = sf.parse(str4);  
    long ld3 = sDt3.getTime() /1000;  
    long ld4 = sDt4.getTime() /1000;
    System.out.println(ld4-ld3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>353
</code></pre>

<p>Why is <code>ld4-ld3</code> not <code>1</code> (as I would expect from the one-second difference in the times), but <code>353</code>?</p>

<p>If I change the dates to times one second later:</p>

<pre><code>String str3 = ""1927-12-31 23:54:08"";  
String str4 = ""1927-12-31 23:54:09"";  
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>ld4-ld3</code> will be <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>What is the use of the <code>yield</code> keyword in Python? What does it do?</p>

<p>For example, I'm trying to understand this code<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>def node._get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):
    if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist &lt; self._median:
        yield self._leftchild
    if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist &gt;= self._median:
        yield self._rightchild  
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the caller:</p>

<pre><code>result, candidates = list(), [self]
while candidates:
    node = candidates.pop()
    distance = node._get_dist(obj)
    if distance &lt;= max_dist and distance &gt;= min_dist:
        result.extend(node._values)
    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))
return result
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when the method <code>_get_child_candidates</code> is called?
A list is returned? A single element is returned? Is it called again? When will subsequent calls stop?</p>

<p>Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"">JSLint</a>, and it gave the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing ""use strict"" statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>""use strict"";</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.</p>

<p>So what is <code>""use strict"";</code> all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?</p>

<p>Do any of the current browsers respond to the <code>""use strict"";</code> string or is it for future use?</p>
